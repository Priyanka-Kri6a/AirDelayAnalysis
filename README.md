# AirDelayAnalysis
A python based data visualisation
In the aviation industry, understanding the causes and patterns of flight delays is crucial for improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project, undertaken as a part of academic learning in the second year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, focuses on analyzing flight delay data using Python and Excel-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The dataset used for this project includes detailed information about various delay causes such as weather, security, carrier, NAS (National Aviation System), and late aircraft delays, along with flight and airport-specific data.
The goal of this analysis is to identify key patterns, correlations, and impactful delay causes across different airlines and airports. The project includes visualization techniques like pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, and heatmaps to make the findings more interpretable and insightful. By conducting this analysis, we aim to develop a foundational understanding of data handling, processing, and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
This hands-on project not only enhances data analysis skills but also gives real-world insights into airline operations and the impact of delays, offering valuable learning and practical exposure to data-driven decision-making.
